## Python versions

To specify which Python versions you would like to work with,
define the `PDM_MULTIRUN_VERSIONS` environment variable:

```bash
export PDM_MULTIRUN_VERSIONS="3.10 3.11 3.12"
```

By default it is set to active versions of Python
(non-EOL, in development).

See [PDM Multirun](https://pawamoy.github.io/pdm-multirun/).

## Dependencies and virtual environments

Dependencies are managed by [PDM](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm).

Use `pdm install` to install the dependencies.

Dependencies are written in `pyproject.toml`,
under the `[project]`, `[project.optional-dependencies]`
and `[tool.pdm.dev-dependencies]` sections.
Example:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[project]
dependencies = [
  "fastapi>=1.0",
  "importlib-metadata>=2.0",
]
```

You can write them there manually, or use the commands provided by PDM:

```bash
pdm add numpy  # add as a required dependency
pdm add -G math numpy  # add as an optional dependency in the "math" group
pdm add -d numpy  # or add as a development dependency in the "dev" group
pdm add -dG stats numpy  # or add as a development dependency in the "stats" group

# the "remove" equivalent
pdm remove numpy
pdm remove -G math numpy
pdm remove -d numpy
pdm remove -dG stats numpy
```

- Use `pdm update` the re-lock the dependencies
  (write the complete dependency resolution in `pdm.lock`)
  and install their updated version.
- Use `pdm lock` to just re-lock the dependencies.
- Use `pdm run CMD [ARGS...]` to run a command installed in `__pypackages__`
- Use `pdm list` to show the list of dependencies.

See `pdm COMMAND --help` for details about each command.

### Installing in `__pypackages__` (PEP 582)

Configure PDM to install dependencies in `__pypackages__`:

```bash
pdm config python.use_venv false
```

### Installing in virtualenvs

Configure PDM to create the different virtualenvs outside of the project:

```bash
pdm config python.use_venv true
pdm config venv.in_project false
```

Then create some virtualenvs:

```bash
pdm venv create 3.8
pdm venv create 3.9
pdm venv create 3.10
pdm venv create 3.11
pdm venv create 3.12
```

And export the `PDM_MULTIRUN_USE_VENVS=1` environment variable.
You can hardcode it in `Makefile` or the `duties.py`
to make it permanent.

## Tasks

The tasks are written in Python (for cross-platform compatibility),
and based on the task-runner called [duty](https://github.com/pawamoy/duty).
They are written in the `duties.py` file,
and decorated with the `@duty` decorator.

Example:

```python title="duties.py"
@duty
def check_docs(ctx):
    """Check if the documentation builds correctly."""
    ctx.run("mkdocs build -s", title="Building documentation")
```

To run a task, use `pdm run duty TASK [ARG=VALUE...]`.
You can run multiple tasks at once: `pdm run duty TASK1 ARG=VALUE TASK2`.
You can list the available tasks with `pdm run duty --list`.

Available tasks:

- `changelog`: Update the changelog in-place with latest commits.
  See [the Changelog section](#changelog).
- `check`: Check it all!
  See [the Quality Analysis section](#quality-analysis).
- `check-quality`: Check the code quality.
  See [the check-quality section](#check-quality).
- `check-dependencies`: Check for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
  See [the check-dependencies section](#check-dependencies).
- `check-docs`: Check if the documentation builds correctly.
  See [the check-docs section](#check-docs).
- `check-types`: Check that the code is correctly typed.
  See [the check-types section](#check-types).
- `clean`: Delete temporary files.
- `coverage`: Report coverage as text and HTML.
- `docs`: Serve the documentation (localhost:8000).
  See [the Documentation section](#documentation).
  Arguments:
    - `host="127.0.0.1"`: The host to serve the docs from.
    - `port=8000`: The port to serve the docs on.
- `format`: Run formatting tools on the code.
- `release`: Release a new Python package.
  See [the Releases section](#releases).
  Arguments:
    - `version` The Python package version.
- `test`: Run the test suite.
  See [the Tests section](#tests).
  Arguments:
    - `match=""`: A pytest expression to filter selected tests.
- `vscode`: Configure VSCode for the project.
  See [VSCode setup](#vscode-setup).

### VSCode setup

If you work in VSCode, we provide a `make vscode` action (`pdm run duty vscode`)
that configures settings and tasks. **It will overwrite the following existing
files, so make sure to back them up:**

- `.vscode/launch.json`
- `.vscode/settings.json`
- `.vscode/tasks.json`

### Makefile

A Makefile is available for convenience. It's just a shortcut to run duties.

Available rules are the same, with additional rules: `help`, `lock` and `setup`.

- `changelog`
- `check`
- `check-quality`
- `check-dependencies`
- `check-docs`
- `check-types`
- `clean`
- `coverage`
- `docs`
- `format`
- `lock`
- `release`
- `setup`
- `test`

The default rule is `help`, so running `make` will show the available rules.
The `setup` rule is explained below.

## Workflow

The first thing you should run when entering your repository is:

```bash
make setup
```

This will install the project's dependencies in `__pypackages__`:
one folder per chosen Python version.
The chosen Python versions are defined in the Makefile.

If you don't have the `make` command,
you can use `bash scripts/setup.sh` instead,
or even just `pdm install`
if you don't plan on using multiple Python versions.

Now you can start writing and editing code in `src/your_package`.

- You can auto-format the code with `make format`.
- You can run a quality analysis with `make check`.
- Once you wrote tests for your new code,
  you can run the test suite with `make test`.
- Once you are ready to publish a new release,
  run `make changelog`, then `make release version=x.y.z`,
  where `x.y.z` is the version added to the changelog.

To summarize, the typical workflow is:

```bash
make setup  # only once

<write code>
make format  # to auto-format the code

<write tests>
make test  # to run the test suite

make check  # to check if everything is OK

<commit your changes>

make changelog  # to update the changelog
<edit changelog if needed>

make release version=x.y.z
```

Remember that `make` is just a shortcut for `pdm run duty` here.

## Quality analysis

The quality checks are started with:

```
make check
```

This action is actually a composition of several checks:

- `check-quality`: Check the code quality.
- `check-dependencies`: Check for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- `check-docs`: Check if the documentation builds correctly.
- `check-types`: Check if the code is correctly typed.
- `check-api`: Check for breaking changes in your Python API.

For example, if you are only interested in checking types,
run `make check-types`.

### check-quality

The code quality analysis is done
with [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).
The analysis is configured in `config/ruff.toml`.
In this file, you can deactivate rules
or activate others to customize your analysis.
Rules identifiers always start with one or more capital letters,
like `D`, `S` or `BLK`, then followed by a number.

You can ignore a rule on a specific code line by appending
a `noqa` comment ("no quality analysis/assurance"):

```python title="src/your_package/module.py"
print("a code line that triggers a Ruff warning")  # noqa: ID
```

...where ID is the identifier of the rule you want to ignore for this line.

Example:

```python title="src/your_package/module.py"
import subprocess
```

```console
$ make check-quality
✗ Checking code quality (1)
  > ruff check --config=config/ruff.toml src/ tests/ scripts/
  src/your_package/module.py:2:1: S404 Consider possible security implications associated with subprocess module.
```

Now add a comment to ignore this warning.

```python title="src/your_package/module.py"
import subprocess  # noqa: S404
```

```console
$ make check-quality
✓ Checking code quality
```

You can disable multiple different warnings on a single line
by separating them with commas:

```python title="src/your_package/module.py"
markdown_docstring = """
    Look at this docstring:

    ```python
    \"\"\"
    print("code block")
    \"\"\"
    ```
"""  # noqa: D300,D301
```

You can disable a warning globally by adding its ID
into the list in `config/ruff.toml`.

You can also disable warnings per file, like so:

```toml title="config/ruff.toml"
[per-file-ignores]
"src/your_package/your_module.py" = [
    "T201",  # Print statement
]
```

### check-dependencies

This action uses the tool [`safety`](https://github.com/pyupio/safety)
to check if the **production** dependencies used in the project
are subject to CVEs by querying an online database.

An example of full report looks like the following:

```
+==============================================================================+
| REPORT                                                                       |
+============================+===========+==========================+==========+
| package                    | installed | affected                 | ID       |
+============================+===========+==========================+==========+
| django                     | 1.2       | <1.2.2                   | 25701    |
+==============================================================================+
| Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Django 1.2.x before 1.2.2 allows |
|  remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a csrfmiddlewar |
| etoken (aka csrf_token) cookie.                                              |
+==============================================================================+
```

### check-docs

This action builds the documentation with strict behavior:
any warning will be considered an error and the command will fail.

The warnings/errors can be about incorrect docstring format,
or invalid cross-references.

See the [Documentation section](#documentation) for more information.

### check-types

This action runs [`mypy`](http://mypy-lang.org/) on the source code
to find potential typing errors.

If you cannot or don't know how to fix a typing error in your code,
as a last resort you can ignore this specific error with a comment:

```python title="src/your_package/module.py"
result = data_dict.get(key, None).value  # type: ignore
```

### check-api

This actions runs [Griffe](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/griffe)
to search for API breaking changes since latest version. It is set
to allow failures, and is more about providing information than
preventing CI to pass.

## Tests

Run the test suite with:

```
make test
```

Behind the scenes, it uses [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)
and plugins to collect and run the tests, and output a report.

Code source coverage is computed thanks to
[coveragepy](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.1/).

Sometimes you don't want to run the whole test suite,
but rather one particular test, or group of tests.
Pytest provides a `-k` option to allow filtering the tests.
The Makefile `test` rule therefore accept a `match=` argument
to specify the value of Pytest's `-k` option:

```
make test match=training
make test match="app and route2"
```

Example of output:

```

```

## Continuous Integration

The quality checks and tests are executed in parallel
in a [GitHub Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).
The CI is configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

To force a step to pass even when it fails,
add `nofail=CI` or `nofail=True` to the corresponding
`ctx.run` instruction in `duties.py`

## Changelog

Changelogs are absolutely useful when your software
is updated regularly, to inform your users about the new features
that were added or the bugs that were fixed.

But writing a changelog manually is a cumbersome process.

This is why we offer, with this template,
a way to automatically update the changelog.
There is one requirement though for it to work:
you must use the
[Angular commit message convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit).

For a quick reference:

```
<type>[(scope)]: Subject

[Body]
```

Scope and body are optional. Type can be:

- `build`: About packaging, building wheels, etc.
- `chore`: About packaging or repo/files management.
- `ci`: About Continuous Integration.
- `docs`: About documentation.
- `feat`: New feature.
- `fix`: Bug fix.
- `perf`: About performance.
- `refactor`: Changes which are not features nor bug fixes.
- `style`: A change in code style/format.
- `tests`: About tests.

The two most important are `feat` and `fix` types.
For other types of commits, you can do as you like.

Subject (and body) must be valid Markdown.
If you write a body, please add issues references at the end:

```
Body.

References: #10, #11.
Fixes #15.
```

Examples:

```
feat: Add training route
```

```
fix: Stop deleting user data
```

Following that convention will allow to generate
new entries in the changelog while following the rules
of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

Once you are ready to publish a new release of your package,
run the following command:

```
make changelog
```

This will update the changelog in-place, using the latest,
unpublished-yet commits.

If this group of commits contains only bug fixes (`fix:`)
and/or commits that are not interesting for users (`chore:`, `style:`, etc.),
the changelog will gain a new **patch** entry.
It means that the new suggested version will be a patch bump
of the previous one: `0.1.1` becomes `0.1.2`.

If this group of commits contains at least one feature (`feat:`),
the changelog will gain a new **minor** entry.
It means that the new suggested version will be a minor bump
of the previous one: `0.1.1` becomes `0.2.0`.

If there is, in this group, a commit whose body contains
something like `Breaking change`,
the changelog will gain a new **major** entry,
unless the version is still an "alpha" version
(starting with 0), in which case it gains a **minor** entry.
It means that the new suggested version will be a major bump
of the previous one: `1.2.1` becomes `2.0.0`,
but `0.2.1` is only bumped up to `0.3.0`.
Moving from "alpha" status to "beta" or "stable" status
is a choice left to the developers,
when they consider the package is ready for it.

Finally, once your changelog has been updated,
make sure its contents are correct (add, remove or edit anything
you need), and use the new version (the one that was added
into the changelog) to create a new release:

```
make release version=x.y.z
```

...where x.y.z is the version added in the changelog.

## Releases

As seen in the previous section, you can use the `release` rule
of the Makefile to publish new versions of the Python package.

Usually, just before running `make release version=x.y.z`,
you run `make changelog` to update the changelog and
use the newly added version as the argument to `make release`.

For example, if after running `make changelog`, the diff
shows a new `0.5.1` entry in the changelog, you must
release this exact same version with `make release version=0.5.1`.

The `release` action does several things, in this order:

- Stage the changelog file (`CHANGELOG.md`)
- Commit the changes with a message like `chore: Prepare release 0.5.1`
- Tag the commit with that version
- Push the commits
- Push the tags
- Build the package dist and wheel
- Publish the dist and wheel to PyPI.org
- Build and deploy the documentation site

## Documentation

The documentation is built with [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/),
the [Material for Mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme,
and the [mkdocstrings](https://github.com/pawamoy/mkdocstrings) plugin.

### Writing

The pages are written in Markdown, and thanks to `mkdocstrings`,
even your Python docstrings can be written in Markdown.
`mkdocstrings` particularly supports the
[Google-style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
for docstrings.

The documentation configuration is written into `mkdocs.yml`,
at the root of the project. The Markdown pages are written
in the `docs/` directory. You can use any level of nesting you want.
The left-sidebar navigation is configured through the `nav` key
in `mkdocs.yml`.

For example, with these docs structure:

```
📁 docs
├── 📄 changelog.md
├── 📄 index.md
└── 📁 reference
    ├── 📄 cli.md
    └── 📄 logic.md
```

...you can have these navigation items in `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml title="mkdocs.yml"
nav:
- Overview: index.md
- Code Reference:
  - cli.py: reference/cli.md
  - logic.py: reference/logic.md
- Changelog: changelog.md
```

Note that we matched the sections in the navigation with the folder tree,
but that is not mandatory.

`mkdocstrings` allows you to inject documentation of Python objects
in Markdown pages with the following syntax:

```md
::: path.to.object
    OPTIONS
```

...where `OPTIONS` is a YAML block containing configuration options
for both the selection of Python objects and their rendering.

You can document an entire module or even package with a single instruction:

```md
::: your_package
```

...but it's usually better to have each module injected in a separate page.

For more information about `mkdocstrings`,
check [its documentation](https://pawamoy.github.io/mkdocstrings).

### Serving

MkDocs provides a development server with files watching and live-reload.
Run `make docs` to serve your documentation on `localhost:8000`.

If you run it in a remote host (Linux VM) and would like to access it
from your local browser, bind the server to 0.0.0.0 instead:

```bash
make docs host=0.0.0.0
```

If needed, you can also change the port used:

```bash
make docs host=0.0.0.0 port=5000
```

### Deploying

MkDocs has a `gh-deploy` command that will deploy
you documentation on GitHub pages.
We make use of this command in the `docs-deploy` action:

```bash
make docs-deploy
```

If you'd prefer to deploy on ReadTheDocs instead,
you will likely have to write
a `readthedocs.yml` configuration file
and enable the project on ReadTheDocs.
