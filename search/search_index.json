Use pdm install to install the dependencies. Dependencies are written in pyproject.toml , under the [project] , [project.optional-dependencies] and [tool.pdm.dev-dependencies] sections. Example: pyproject.toml [project] dependencies = [ \"fastapi~=1.0\" , \"importlib-metadata~=2.0\" , ] You can write them there manually, or use the commands provided by PDM: pdm add numpy # add as a required dependency pdm add -G math numpy # add as an optional dependency in the \"math\" group pdm add -d numpy # or add as a development dependency in the \"dev\" group pdm add -dG stats numpy # or add as a development dependency in the \"stats\" group # the \"remove\" equivalent pdm remove numpy pdm remove -G math numpy pdm remove -d numpy pdm remove -dG stats numpy Use pdm update the re-lock the dependencies (write the complete dependency resolution in pdm.lock ) and install their updated version. Use pdm lock to just re-lock the dependencies. Use pdm run CMD [ARGS...] to run a command installed in __pypackages__ Use pdm list to show the list of dependencies. See pdm COMMAND --help for details about each command. Tasks \u00a4 The tasks are written in Python (for cross-platform compatibility), and based on the task-runner called duty . They are written in the duties.py file, and decorated with the @duty decorator. Example: duties.py @duty def check_docs ( ctx ): \"\"\"Check if the documentation builds correctly.\"\"\" ctx . run ( \"mkdocs build -s\" , title = \"Building documentation\" ) To run a task, use pdm run duty TASK [ARG=VALUE...] . You can run multiple tasks at once: pdm run duty TASK1 ARG=VALUE TASK2 . You can list the available tasks with pdm run duty --list . Available tasks: changelog : Update the changelog in-place with latest commits. See the Changelog section . check : Check it all! See the Quality Analysis section . check-quality : Check the code quality. See the check-quality section . check-dependencies : Check for vulnerabilities in dependencies. See the check-dependencies section . check-docs : Check if the documentation builds correctly. See the check-docs section . check-types : Check that the code is correctly typed. See the check-types section . clean : Delete temporary files. coverage : Report coverage as text and HTML. docs : Build the documentation locally. See the Documentation section . docs-serve : Serve the documentation (localhost:8000). Arguments: host=\"127.0.0.1\" : The host to serve the docs from. port=8000 : The port to serve the docs on. format : Run formatting tools on the code. release : Release a new Python package. See the Releases section . Arguments: version The Python package version. test : Run the test suite. See the Tests section . Arguments: match=\"\" : A pytest expression to filter selected tests. Makefile \u00a4 A Makefile is available for convenience. It's just a shortcut to run duties. Available rules are the same, with additional rules: help , lock and setup . changelog check check-quality check-dependencies check-docs check-types clean coverage docs docs-serve format lock release setup test The default rule is help , so running make will show the available rules. The setup rule is explained below. Workflow \u00a4 The first thing you should run when entering your repository is: make setup This will install the project's dependencies in __pypackages__ : one folder per chosen Python version. The chosen Python versions are defined in both scripts setup.sh and multirun.sh in the scripts/ folder. You can change them here permanently, or temporarily with the PYTHON_VERSIONS environment variable. If you don't have the make command, you can use bash scripts/setup.sh instead, or even just pdm install if you don't plan on using multiple Python versions. Now you can start writing and editing code in src/your_package . You can auto-format the code with make format . You can run a quality analysis with make check . Once you wrote tests for your new code, you can run the test suite with make test . Once you are ready to publish a new release, run make changelog , then make release version=x.y.z , where x.y.z is the version added to the changelog. To summarize, the typical workflow is: make setup # only once <write code> make format # to auto-format the code <write tests> make test # to run the test suite make check # to check if everything is OK <commit your changes> make changelog # to update the changelog <edit changelog if needed> make release version = x.y.z Remember that make is just a shortcut for pdm run duty here. Quality analysis \u00a4 The quality checks are started with: make check This action is actually a composition of several checks: check-quality : Check the code quality. check-dependencies : Check for vulnerabilities in dependencies. check-docs : Check if the documentation builds correctly. check-types : Check if the code is correctly typed. For example, if you are only interested in checking types, run make check-types . check-quality \u00a4 The code quality analysis is done with Flake8 , and a battery of Flake8 plugins. The analysis is configured in config/flake8.ini . In this file, you can deactivate rules or activate others to customize your analysis. Rules identifiers always start with one or more capital letters, like D , S or BLK , then followed by a number. You can ignore a rule on a specific code line by appending a noqa comment (\"no quality analysis/assurance\"): src/your_package/module.py print ( \"a code line that triggers a flake8 warning\" ) # noqa: ID ...where ID is the identifier of the rule you want to ignore for this line. Example: src/your_package/module.py import subprocess $ make check-quality \u2717 Checking code quality (1) > flake8 --config=config/flake8.ini src/ tests/ scripts/ src/your_package/module.py:2:1: S404 Consider possible security implications associated with subprocess module. Now add a comment to ignore this warning.

For GitHub, the CI is configured in .github/workflows/ci.yml , and for GitLab it's configured in .gitlab-ci.yml . To force a step to pass even when it fails, add nofail=CI or nofail=True to the corresponding ctx.run instruction in duties.py Changelog \u00a4 Changelogs are absolutely useful when your software is updated regularly, to inform your users about the new features that were added or the bugs that were fixed. But writing a changelog manually is a cumbersome process. This is why we offer, with this template, a way to automatically update the changelog. There is one requirement though for it to work: you must use the Angular commit message convention . For a quick reference: <type>[(scope)]: Subject [Body] Scope and body are optional. Type can be: build : About packaging, building wheels, etc. chore : About packaging or repo/files management. ci : About Continuous Integration. docs : About documentation. feat : New feature. fix : Bug fix. perf : About performance. refactor : Changes which are not features nor bug fixes. style : A change in code style/format. tests : About tests. The two most important are feat and fix types. For other types of commits, you can do as you like. Subject (and body) must be valid Markdown. If you write a body, please add issues references at the end: Body. References: #10, #11. Fixes #15. Examples: feat: Add training route fix: Stop deleting user data Following that convention will allow to generate new entries in the changelog while following the rules of semantic versioning . Once you are ready to publish a new release of your package, run the following command: make changelog This will update the changelog in-place, using the latest, unpublished-yet commits. If this group of commits contains only bug fixes ( fix: ) and/or commits that are not interesting for users ( chore: , style: , etc.), the changelog will gain a new patch entry. It means that the new suggested version will be a patch bump of the previous one: 0.1.1 becomes 0.1.2 . If this group of commits contains at least one feature ( feat: ), the changelog will gain a new minor entry. It means that the new suggested version will be a minor bump of the previous one: 0.1.1 becomes 0.2.0 . If there is, in this group, a commit whose body contains something like Breaking change , the changelog will gain a new major entry, unless the version is still an \"alpha\" version (starting with 0), in which case it gains a minor entry. It means that the new suggested version will be a major bump of the previous one: 1.2.1 becomes 2.0.0 , but 0.2.1 is only bumped up to 0.3.0 . Moving from \"alpha\" status to \"beta\" or \"stable\" status is a choice left to the developers, when they consider the package is ready for it. Finally, once your changelog has been updated, make sure its contents are correct (add, remove or edit anything you need), and use the new version (the one that was added into the changelog) to create a new release: make release version=x.y.z ...where x.y.z is the version added in the changelog. Releases \u00a4 As seen in the previous section, you can use the release rule of the Makefile to publish new versions of the Python package. Usually, just before running make release version=x.y.z , you run make changelog to update the changelog and use the newly added version as the argument to make release . For example, if after running make changelog , the diff shows a new 0.5.1 entry in the changelog, you must release this exact same version with make release version=0.5.1 . The release action does several things, in this order: Update the version in pyproject.toml Stage the modified files ( pyproject.toml and CHANGELOG.md ) Commit the changes with a message like chore: Prepare release 0.5.1 Tag the commit with that version Push the commits Push the tags Build the package dist and wheel Publish the dist and wheel to PyPI.org Documentation \u00a4 The documentation is built with Mkdocs , the Material for Mkdocs theme, and the mkdocstrings plugin. Writing \u00a4 The pages are written in Markdown, and thanks to mkdocstrings , even your Python docstrings can be written in Markdown. mkdocstrings particularly supports the Google-style for docstrings. The documentation configuration is written into mkdocs.yml , at the root of the project. The Markdown pages are written in the docs/ directory. You can use any level of nesting you want. The left-sidebar navigation is configured through the nav key in mkdocs.yml . For example, with these docs structure: \ud83d\udcc1 docs \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 changelog.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 index.md \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc1 reference \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 cli.md \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 logic.md ...you can have these navigation items in mkdocs.yml : mkdocs.yml nav : - Overview : index.md - Code Reference : - cli.py : reference/cli.md - logic.py : reference/logic.md - Changelog : changelog.md Note that we matched the sections in the navigation with the folder tree, but that is not mandatory. mkdocstrings allows you to inject documentation of Python objects in Markdown pages with the following syntax: ::: path.to.object OPTIONS ...where OPTIONS is a YAML block containing configuration options for both the selection of Python objects and their rendering. You can document an entire module or even package with a single instruction: ::: your_package ...but it's usually better to have each module injected in a separate page. For more information about mkdocstrings , check its documentation . Serving \u00a4 MkDocs provides a development server with files watching and live-reload. Run make docs-serve to serve your documentation on localhost:8000 . If you run it in a remote host (Linux VM) and would like to access it from your local browser, bind the server to 0.0.0.0 instead: make docs-serve host = 0 .0.0.0 If needed, you can also change the port used: make docs-serve host = 0 .0.0.0 port = 5000 Deploying \u00a4 MkDocs has a gh-deploy command that will deploy you documentation on GitHub pages. We make use of this command in the docs-deploy action: make docs-deploy If you'd prefer to deploy on ReadTheDocs instead, you will likely have to write a readthedocs.yml configuration file and enable the project on ReadTheDocs.","title":"Working on a project"},{"location":"work/#working-on-a-project","text":"The generated project has this structure: \ud83d\udcc1 your_project ------------------- # your freshly created project! \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 CHANGELOG.md --------------- # \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md --------- # \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc1 config --------------------- # tools configuration files \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 coverage.ini ----------- # \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 flake8.ini ------------- # \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 mypy.ini --------------- # \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 pytest.ini ------------- # \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 CONTRIBUTING.md ------------ # \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc1 docs ----------------------- # documentation pages \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 changelog.md ----------- # \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 code_of_conduct.md ----- # \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 contributing.md -------- # \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc1 css -------------------- # extra CSS files \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 mkdocstrings.css --- # \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 gen_credits.py --------- # script to generate credits \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 gen_ref_nav.py --------- # script to generate code reference nav \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 index.md --------------- # \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 license.md ------------- # \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 duties.py ------------------ # the project's tasks \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 LICENSE -------------------- # \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 Makefile ------------------- # \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 mkdocs.yml ----------------- # docs configuration \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 pyproject.toml ------------- # project metadata and dependencies \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 README.md ------------------ # \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc1 scripts -------------------- # helper scripts \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 multirun.sh ------------ # to run a command against multiple Python versions \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 setup.sh --------------- # to install dependencies for multiple Python versions \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc1 src ------------------------ # the source code directory \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc1 your_package ----------- # your package \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 cli.py ------------- # the command line entry point \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 __init__.py -------- # \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 __main__.py -------- # \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc1 tests ---------------------- # the tests directory \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 conftest.py ------------ # pytest fixtures, etc. \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 __init__.py ------------ # \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 test_cli.py ------------ #","title":"Working on a project"},{"location":"work/#dependencies-and-virtual-environments","text":"Dependencies are managed by PDM .

If this group of commits contains only bug fixes ( fix: ) and/or commits that are not interesting for users ( chore: , style: , etc.), the changelog will gain a new patch entry. It means that the new suggested version will be a patch bump of the previous one: 0.1.1 becomes 0.1.2 . If this group of commits contains at least one feature ( feat: ), the changelog will gain a new minor entry. It means that the new suggested version will be a minor bump of the previous one: 0.1.1 becomes 0.2.0 . If there is, in this group, a commit whose body contains something like Breaking change , the changelog will gain a new major entry, unless the version is still an \"alpha\" version (starting with 0), in which case it gains a minor entry. It means that the new suggested version will be a major bump of the previous one: 1.2.1 becomes 2.0.0 , but 0.2.1 is only bumped up to 0.3.0 . Moving from \"alpha\" status to \"beta\" or \"stable\" status is a choice left to the developers, when they consider the package is ready for it. Finally, once your changelog has been updated, make sure its contents are correct (add, remove or edit anything you need), and use the new version (the one that was added into the changelog) to create a new release: make release version=x.y.z ...where x.y.z is the version added in the changelog.","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"work/#releases","text":"As seen in the previous section, you can use the release rule of the Makefile to publish new versions of the Python package. Usually, just before running make release version=x.y.z , you run make changelog to update the changelog and use the newly added version as the argument to make release . For example, if after running make changelog , the diff shows a new 0.5.1 entry in the changelog, you must release this exact same version with make release version=0.5.1 . The release action does several things, in this order: Update the version in pyproject.toml Stage the modified files ( pyproject.toml and CHANGELOG.md ) Commit the changes with a message like chore: Prepare release 0.5.1 Tag the commit with that version Push the commits Push the tags Build the package dist and wheel Publish the dist and wheel to PyPI.org","title":"Releases"},{"location":"work/#documentation","text":"The documentation is built with Mkdocs , the Material for Mkdocs theme, and the mkdocstrings plugin.","title":"Documentation"},{"location":"work/#writing","text":"The pages are written in Markdown, and thanks to mkdocstrings , even your Python docstrings can be written in Markdown. mkdocstrings particularly supports the Google-style for docstrings. The documentation configuration is written into mkdocs.yml , at the root of the project. The Markdown pages are written in the docs/ directory. You can use any level of nesting you want. The left-sidebar navigation is configured through the nav key in mkdocs.yml . For example, with these docs structure: \ud83d\udcc1 docs \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 changelog.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 index.md \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc1 reference \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 cli.md \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 logic.md ...you can have these navigation items in mkdocs.yml : mkdocs.yml nav : - Overview : index.md - Code Reference : - cli.py : reference/cli.md - logic.py : reference/logic.md - Changelog : changelog.md Note that we matched the sections in the navigation with the folder tree, but that is not mandatory. mkdocstrings allows you to inject documentation of Python objects in Markdown pages with the following syntax: ::: path.to.object OPTIONS ...where OPTIONS is a YAML block containing configuration options for both the selection of Python objects and their rendering. You can document an entire module or even package with a single instruction: ::: your_package ...but it's usually better to have each module injected in a separate page.
